# Dev diary

This is a log of the prompts given to the AI coding assistant (Claude Code) during the challenge. Each entry pairs the prompt with a summary of what the assistant found or did. Prompts are quoted verbatim.

## 2026-10-01 · 1. Initialise CLAUDE.md

**Prompt**
> /init

**Findings**
- The repo contained only a .NET `.gitignore`, so the solution is expected to be C#/.NET. There was no code, README or AI-tool config yet.
- The challenge brief and the `rockets` test program are in the sibling folder `../lunar-backend-engineer-challenge/`.
- The brief's key constraints are:
  - Messages arrive out of order and are delivered at least once.
  - Any non-2xx response triggers redelivery.
  - Speed messages are deltas, so they must be applied in `messageNumber` order without double-counting.
  - Grading uses the test program's defaults, so the service must listen on `http://localhost:8088/messages`.

**Actions**
- Created `CLAUDE.md`, which covers:
  - the requirements and how messages behave
  - how to run the test program
  - the assessment criteria, including the instruction to raise design decisions with the developer instead of making them silently

## 2026-10-01 · 2. Start a dev diary

**Prompt**
> As this is a coding challenge where the use of AI is part of the assessment I want you to keep a diary of prompts together with a summary of findings or actions taken. Put this diary in docs/devdiary.md. Pin this as a memory

**Actions**
- Created this diary (`docs/devdiary.md`) and backfilled the entry for the earlier prompt.
- Saved a pinned assistant memory, so future sessions keep adding an entry for every prompt.

## 2026-10-01 · 3. Record the diary rule in CLAUDE.md and commit

**Prompt**
> yes, add it to CLAUDE.md and commit

**Actions**
- Added a "Dev diary" section to `CLAUDE.md`. The rule now lives in the repo as well as in the assistant's local memory.
- Committed `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/devdiary.md`.
